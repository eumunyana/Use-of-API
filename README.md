# Use-of-API
A small application that incorporates the use of APIs.

This is a small website that incorporates a google map API that will help the user to search restaurants nearby. I used HTML to structure the website, CSS to style the website and JavaScript to build the functionality of the website and lastly I code a python program to run the API.
